Themes
++++++

Themes are a set settings defined for User Interface preferences of the site. A variety of options are available to choose from such as changing the background color, site title, form labels etc..

.. warning::

	When a Theme is added, it will not be activated until the active field is set to Yes. Keep in mind that if you change the slug fields to something other than the default value you'll need to restart the server to see the corrsponding changes in URL bar to take place because URL's are loaded only on server load.

	For activating a particular theme you need to set the Active field as Yes, only one theme can stay active at a time as a result only one of the themes will have this field set as Yes.
