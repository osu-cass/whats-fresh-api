Usage
=====

The What's Fresh API web app is used to enter the data that is displayed in the What's Fresh Mobile app. It consists of a series of simple forms for each type of object that can be added to the database. Required fields are marked with a *, and any errors or missing items will be flagged when the form is saved. The data will not be saved until errors are corrected.

Objects
-------

There are seven major objects in What's Fresh: Vendors, Products, Preparations, Stories, Videos, Images and Themes. When you log in to the application, the first screen you see is the Entry screen, which lists the objects. Clicking on one of the object buttons will bring you to a screen listing all of the objects already saved in the system.

For example, clicking Vendors will display a table listing all the Vendors currently in the system. On this screen you can add a new Vendor by clicking the yellow "New Vendor" button at the top of the list, or edit any of the existing Vendors by clicking on that Vendor.


Adding and Editing
------------------

The forms for editing and for adding new objects are the same, except that the edit form will already be filled out with the existing data. You can edit this data and save the changes using the "Save" button at the bottom of the form, or delete the entire record using the red "Delete" button on the top of the form.

Workflow
++++++++

The objects in What's Fresh sometimes depend on other objects. We recommend the following work flows to add different objects:

**Products**

1.	Determine what Preparations are available for this Product (smoked, dried, fresh, etc).
2.	Create the Preparation objects if they don't already exist.
3.  You can directly create the required preparation within the product form itself.
4.	If there is an Image for this Product, create an Image object (be sure to give the image a unique and descriptive name).
5.	If this Product has a Story, make sure that Story exists (for instance, the Salmon story will probably be shared by all varieties of Salmon).
6.	Create the Product object, selecting the correct Story and Image, and add each applicable preparation.

**Vendors**

1.	Make sure this Vendor's Products are added (see above).
2.	If the Vendor has a Story (rare), create the Story object.
3.	Create the Vendor object, adding the correct Products and selecting a Story, if applicable.

**Stories**

1.  You can directly create new images from the story form itself.
2.  You can directly create new videos from the story form itself.

See below for details on adding these objects.

Vendors
+++++++

These are the records for businesses that sell products. Vendors are also specific to a location, so if Bob's Fish has two different locations where they sell their Products, each location will be a separate Vendor. These can be distinguished by name, for instance Bob's Fish Newport and Bob's Fish Waldport.

The address for a Vendor should be the actual location where they sell their Products, not an office or P.O. box.

**Required Data**

Certain information is required to create a new Vendor, make sure you know these items before starting:

*Name*
	The name of the business.
*Hours*
	The typical hours of operation.
*Description*
	A brief description of the business.
*Address*
	The address field where address of the vendor is submitted
	This address is broken into parts and stored as street, city, state and zip.
*Contact Name*
	The primary contact name for this Vendor.
*Products*
	(At least one product should be added).

.. note::

	When a Product is added, you must also select a Preparation for that product. A vendor may sell different preparations for the same Product, or only one of many possible preparations for a Product. For example, a Vendor may sell smoked, frozen and fresh salmon, and also may sell shrimp, but only frozen, not fresh. Every Product/Preparation combination the vendor sells should be added.

.. note::

	Street addresses are turned into GPS coordinates for display on a map in the Mobile app, so it is important to be accurate.


**Optional Data**

Additionally, there are several optional fields:

*Story*
	Select from an existing Story (see the entry on Story objects below)
*In Port*
	The current status of the Vendor, if they sell from a boat, or only when the boat is in port. (Not used currently).

	Different varieties of a particular product should be treated as separate products, if they are sold as such.
